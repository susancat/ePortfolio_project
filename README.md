A web application based on Django. It was designed for software engineering students and their mentor/teacher to interactively share the process of Worked-Based Learning. Students select the courses and process all requirements under that course. They gather and upload all materials for supporting and proving their competences. Mentors and teachers can supervise them via the system and give feedback.
